# 100 Days Of Code - R1 Log

### Day 1: Sunday, January 07, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a new book, Fire & Fury.  Read up to chapter 1.

**Thoughts:** I can't remember the last time I read a book for pleasure.  I used to be a devourer of books.  I decided to start reading again and I can't wait to continue.

**Link to work:** [Fire & Fury](https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Fury-Inside-Trump-White-ebook/dp/B077F4WZZY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515438298&sr=8-1&keywords=fire+%26+fury)
